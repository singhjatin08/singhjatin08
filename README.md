I'm Jatin Singh, a PHP web developer with over three years of experience building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I work out of Delhi NCR.

My area of expertise is developing back-end and front-end web solutions that assist companies in building a powerful online presence. HTML/CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, React JS, Bootstrap, Core PHP, and CodeIgniter are among the technologies in which I am proficient. I concentrate on creating aesthetically pleasing websites that are also incredibly functional, search engine optimized, and scalable.

I can create captivating interfaces and optimize visual components for web applications thanks to my expertise in Photoshop and creative edge in UI/UX design. My strategy is always focused on the user, with the goal of providing smooth and intuitive experiences on all platforms.
